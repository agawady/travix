Because this is an interview assignemnt with limited time, I gave my efforts to pass a simple test for the whole service rather than following a TDD approch from the beginning, the test included calling mock services for the 2 suppliers, mapping response from suppliers to BusyFlightResponse and merging and sorting the results. this smoke test passed.

The 90 minutes were over before Some Important parts are implemented, these are:

1. Date Formatting and validation, and their unit tests.
2. Validations for nummber of passengers and IATA Codes, and their unit tests.
